# Custom STL-like Library in C
  Welcome to the Custom STL-like Library in C! This repository contains a collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms, inspired by the Standard Template Library (STL)   found in C++. The goal of this project is to provide foundational components that can be used and extended for various applications.
## Features
## Data Structures
- Vector
  - A dynamic array that automatically resizes as elements are added. Provides random access and efficient appends.
- Stack
  - A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Supports standard operations like push, pop, and peek.
- Queue
  - A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. Supports enqueue and dequeue operations.
