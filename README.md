# C Standard Template Library (STL) - Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **C Standard Template Library (STL)**! This library is a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in pure C, inspired by the C++ STL. Whether you are building a small project or working on a larger software system, this library is designed to provide reusable, efficient, and modular components for various computational needs.

## üìö Features Overview

### Data Structures
This library includes the following core data structures:
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Efficient for sorted data storage and retrieval.
- **Graph**: Represent and manipulate networks, supporting both directed and undirected graphs.
- **Hash Table**: Fast key-value mapping with collision handling via chaining or open addressing.
- **Heap**: Min-Heap and Max-Heap for priority queues and efficient sorting.
- **Linked List**: Includes singly, doubly, and circular variants for flexible dynamic storage.
- **Queue**: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure for task scheduling and processing, includes circular queue.
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure for expression evaluation and backtracking.
- **Vector**: Dynamic array offering automatic resizing, with fast access and modification.

### Algorithms
In addition to data structures, the library implements various classical algorithms:
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  
- **Searching Algorithms**:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

### Key Highlights
- **Modularity**: Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own module, allowing you to use only what you need.
- **Efficiency**: Designed to minimize overhead and provide high performance, with constant-time operations for hash table lookups, logarithmic time for BST searches, and more.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensures safe memory usage with error handling for edge cases like memory allocation failure.

## üíª Installation and Setup

### Cloning the Repository
To get started with this library, clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Compiling the Library
This library is designed to be compiled using `gcc` or any other C compiler. Simply include the `.c` and `.h` files for the data structures and algorithms you wish to use in your project.

Example of compiling a program that uses the vector and sorting algorithm:
```bash
gcc -o main main.c vector.c sorting_algo.c
```

## üîç How to Use

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
BST supports efficient searching, insertion, and deletion:
```c
#include "bst.h"

int main() {
    bst_t *tree = bst_create();
    bst_insert(tree, 50);
    bst_insert(tree, 30);
    bst_insert(tree, 70);
    
    bst_node_t *found = bst_search(tree, 70);
    if (found) {
        printf("Node with key 70 found!\n");
    }

    bst_destroy(tree);
    return 0;
}
```

### Hash Table
Use a hash table for efficient key-value mapping:
```c
#include "hashtable.h"

int main() {
    hashtable_t *ht = hashtable_create(100);
    hashtable_insert(ht, "key1", "value1");
    hashtable_insert(ht, "key2", "value2");

    char *value = hashtable_search(ht, "key1");
    if (value) {
        printf("Found value: %s\n", value);
    }

    hashtable_destroy(ht);
    return 0;
}
```

### Graph
Graphs support both directed and undirected modes:
```c
#include "graph.h"

int main() {
    graph_t *graph = graph_create(5);
    graph_add_edge(graph, 0, 1);
    graph_add_edge(graph, 0, 4);
    graph_add_edge(graph, 1, 4);
    graph_add_edge(graph, 1, 2);

    graph_bfs(graph, 0);  // Perform Breadth-First Search starting from node 0

    graph_destroy(graph);
    return 0;
}
```
